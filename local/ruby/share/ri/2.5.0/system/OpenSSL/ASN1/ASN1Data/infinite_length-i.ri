A boolean value indicating whether the encoding uses ;TI"Iindefinite length (in the case of parsing) or whether an indefinite ;TI"7length form shall be used (in the encoding case). ;TI"KIn DER, every value uses definite length form. But in scenarios where ;TI"Klarge amounts of data need to be transferred it might be desirable to ;TI"4have some kind of streaming support available. ;TI"JFor example, huge OCTET STRINGs are preferably sent in smaller-sized ;TI"chunks, each at a time. ;TI"HThis is possible in BER by setting the length bytes of an encoding ;TI"Eto zero and by this indicating that the following value will be ;TI"Isent in chunks. Indefinite length encodings are always constructed. ;TI"FThe end of such a stream of chunks is indicated by sending a EOC ;TI"K(End of Content) tag. SETs and SEQUENCEs may use an indefinite length ;TI"Fencoding, but also primitive types such as e.g. OCTET STRINGS or ;TI"CBIT STRINGS may leverage this functionality (cf. ITU-T X.690).;T:
